Java JWT: JSON Web Token for Java and Android
JJWT aims to be the easiest to use and understand library for creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) on the JVM and Android.

JJWT is a pure Java implementation based exclusively on the JWT, JWS, JWE, JWK and JWA RFC specifications and open source under the terms of the Apache 2.0 License.

The library was created by Les Hazlewood and is supported and maintained by a community of contributors.

We've also added some convenience extensions that are not part of the specification, such as JWS compression and claim enforcement.
